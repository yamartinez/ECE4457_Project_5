def calculate_path_loss_db(d_meters):
	'''
	Calculate the free space path loss for a transmission `d` meters.

	The return value is in decibels.
	'''


	# dummy value, replace this
	return 11.0



def calculate_snr_db(tx_power_db, path_loss_db, noise_db):
	'''
	Calculate the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver based on
	the transmit power, the path loss, and the noise at the receiver.

	All values, including the return value, are in decibels.
